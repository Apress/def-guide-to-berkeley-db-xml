See the book or the BDB XML reference for instructions on compiling Java 
examples. Remember that you need the BDB XML .jar files in your classpath, 
as well as the BDB XML library files in your dynamic linker environment 
(LD_LIBRARY_PATH, or similar on different platforms).

The Java examples do not use exception handling, but you should in your own
applications.
